# Flow Control
The Server sends packets with exponential rate. It means that it sends the messages in groups of 2^n, starting with n=0 and increasing it by 1 for every consequent group. After every packet group it doubles its sending rate until client informs it about too many missing packets. The Server shall then halve its sending rate, while prioritizing resending packets missed.

The Client shall inform the server about percentage of missed packets once the average over last 1000 packets sent is greater than 10%. The special packet shall then be sent informing about the percentage of missed packets, so that the Server can adjust its sending speed.
